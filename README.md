# DevOps helps to answer "How fast I can delivery the product to my customers ?"

DevOps is a software development and delivery strategy that emphasizes communication and collaboration between product management, software development, and operations professionals.

It supports this by automating and monitoring the process of software integration, testing, deployment, and infrastructure changes by establishing a culture and environment where building, testing, and releasing software can happen rapidly, frequently, and more reliably.

DevOps is a truly cross-functional mode of working
